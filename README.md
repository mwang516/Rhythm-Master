# My Personal Project

## Proposal:

For my personal project, I want to design a **rhythm game** that can be
played by pressing keys in sync with the beat to achieve a high score. 
The game will eventually have a graphical interface, but the specifics 
of the game and how it will actually look is to be determined later.
This application will be used by anyone who likes rhythm games such as
Osu, Arcaea, or Phigros just to name a few. it could also be for
anyone who wants to try this genre of gaming. It is of interest
to me because I am really into rhythm games and instrumental music.
With this project, I'll be able to make my own beatmap for songs that
I like and design a rhythm game to my likings, which will be really
exciting.
