# My Personal Project

## Proposal:

For my personal project, I want to design a **rhythm game** that can be
played by pressing keys in sync with the beat to achieve a high score. In 
the console-based phase, the user will be able to **create their own account**
and record information about themselves such as name, age, etc. In
addition, they will have a selections of songs to choose from where they
have the option to favourite songs they like. The game will eventually have a graphical interface, but the specifics
of the game and how it will actually look is to be determined later, but the 
functionality is that the player will be able to play the song of their choice. 

This application will be used by anyone who likes rhythm games such as
Osu, Arcaea, or Phigros just to name a few. it could also be for
anyone who wants to try this genre of gaming. It is of interest
to me because I am really into rhythm games and instrumental music.
With this project, I'll be able to make my own beat map for songs that
I like and design a rhythm game to my likings, which will be really
exciting. 

## User Stories:
In the context of the rhythm game, my *user stories* are as follows: 
- As a user, I want to be able to create my own account for the game
- As a user, I want to be able to save and view my progress to my own account
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all the songs available to play
- As a user, I want to be able to favourite songs that I like from the list of all songs
- As a user, I want to be able to select a song to play at random
- As a user, I want to be able to use key controls to play the game
- As a user, I want to be able to implement custom controls
- As a user, I want to be able to view my scores at the end of each songs
